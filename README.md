## The Problem We Solve: "Education Accessibility: Develop inclusive applications that utilize generative AI to make education more accessible to individuals with disabilities, ensuring equal learning opportunities for all."
"In traditional classrooms, a one-size-fits-all approach falls short, particularly for physically challenged students. Our mission at Studiesy is to foster inclusive and empowering learning environments for every student, addressing doubts, offering lesson replays, and providing reliable guidance for a brighter educational future."

## Solution
Our product will have the following features:

### 1. Live Transcription

"Live transcriptions bring magic to every classroom, ensuring inclusivity and accessibility for all students. No one misses out on the learning journey."

### 2.Daily class summaries of the class

"On their way home, students receive neatly summarized class notes, enhancing their learning experience and reinforcing classroom teachings."

### 3. A Chatbot Powered by Your Teacher's Wisdom! 

"Meet your companion chatbot: your teacher's wisdom distilled. Say goodbye to searching for facts in the online sea; trust your ally at your fingertips."

### 4. AudioSmart Summaries

"Imagine a world where students not only read but also hear their daily class summaries. Innovation that empowers the visually impaired and those who benefit from repeated listening. It's knowledge harmonized for all, transforming the classroom experience."

### 5. Teacher's Record: Unleash the Magic!

"Teachers hit record, and the magic unfolds! Live transcriptions, summarized notes, and audio options make learning incredible. A helpful chatbot ensures accurate answers to your questions."
